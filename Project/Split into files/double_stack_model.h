//This is a unique double stack model I thought to store and traverse through a set of values.
//Basically, we need a Data structure such that we can move through different elements of the Data Structure, without losing ordering.
//I also wanted to add the option of adding a new value in between.

//This could have been implemented by a linked list, but I wanted to try something new in this project.
//Thus I have come with a double stack model.
//Here we have a primary stack and a secondary stack.

//We initially deal with the primary stack. All the data points we wish to store are put in the primary stack.
//Then, if we wish to go back to an old element at a certain point, we pop off elements and push them onto the secondary stack.
//When we reach the element we wanted, we can add more elements on top of it directly.

//Thus, we have found a way to model the dynamic ordering of data points.
// A right move means to pop from 2 and push onto 1.
// A left move mean to pop from 1 and push onto 2.
// Insertions always happen on 1 and control/current image is always on the 1st stack
// You can also delete an unwanted image.
